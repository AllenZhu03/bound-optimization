Linear regression and logistic regression under bound constrained optimization in Python.
This implementation is used for comparing the output of Spark MLlib linear regression under bound constrained optimization [SPARK-20029](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-20029) and logistic regression under bound constrained optimization [SPARK-20047](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-20047).
